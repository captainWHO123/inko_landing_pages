## 1. The Service We Provide

We provide a product that combines a **software application** with a **hardware audio recording device**.

The Service allows users to record audio using the device and access, manage, and analyze audio files through the accompanying application and related services.

The Service is provided as a tool to assist users and does not guarantee specific outcomes or results.

---

## 2. User Responsibilities

By using the Service, you agree that:

* You are solely responsible for the content you record, upload, or otherwise submit through the Service
* You confirm that you have the **legal right and authorization** to record and upload any audio content
* You will not use the Service for any **illegal, unauthorized, or unlawful purposes**, including but not limited to violating applicable recording, privacy, or consent laws

We are not responsible for content uploaded by users or for how users choose to use the Service.

---

## 3. AI Analysis and Output Disclaimer

The Service may include AI-powered analysis of audio content.

* AI-generated analysis and outputs are provided **for informational and reference purposes only**
* Such outputs do **not constitute legal, financial, medical, or professional advice**
* Users are responsible for evaluating and relying on AI outputs at their own discretion

We do not guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or reliability of AI-generated content.

---

## 4. Service Availability

We aim to provide a reliable service, but:

* The Service is provided on an **"as is" and "as available"** basis
* We do not guarantee uninterrupted or error-free operation
* The Service may be temporarily unavailable due to maintenance, updates, technical issues, or other operational reasons

---

## 5. Limitation of Liability

To the maximum extent permitted by law:

* We are not liable for any **indirect, incidental, consequential, or special damages**, including but not limited to loss of data, loss of profits, or business interruption
* Our liability is limited to damages arising directly from the use of the Service, where applicable

Some jurisdictions do not allow certain liability limitations, so these limitations may not apply to all users.

---

## 6. Termination and Changes

* You may stop using the Service at any time
* We reserve the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue the Service, in whole or in part, at any time

Continued use of the Service after changes are made constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.

---

## 7. Governing Law

These Terms are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the applicable jurisdiction, without regard to conflict of law principles.
